# Don't String Me Along 

Don't String Me Along is a coding challenge that is sometimes great and sometimes makes you wish you never met.

## Description

In this exercise you must will solve a number of challenges for dealing with manipulating and searching strings in various ways.

## Objectives

1. Fork this repository to your own GitHub profile and clone to your local machine.

2. Write a function that finds the missing numbers when given a string of numbers. For example, if given the string "9899100101103104105" your function will return an array with the values of [2, 6, 7]. You are looking for numbers between 0 - 9.

3. Write a function that takes a string of two words as input such as a name and swaps the order of the words with a comma separating the two words. Ex. "Jay Won" => "Won, Jay".

4.  Write a function that takes 2 strings as input and tests if the first string can be found in a circular variation of the second string. it should return a Boolean value.

5.  Write a function that takes a single word as input and tests if it is a palindrome (ex. racecar), the same forwards as backwards.


Objective #2

Your function is able to parse a string and figure out what the range is before finding what's missing. If given "9899100101103104105", it will return the value of [102] since it seems like the string is a collection of numbers between 98 to 105.

Objective #3

Bonus: Use RegEx to solve this problem.

Objective #5

Bonus: Test for the existence of any palindromes in a word
